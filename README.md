Telecom Churn Analysis 
Project Summary -
Telecom companies often struggle with customer churn, which refers to the number of customers who leave the company over a given period. In this project, we aimed to analyze the churn rate of a telecom company and identify the factors that contribute to customer churn.

Problem Statement
Telecom networks comprise interconnected communication devices and equipment,
facilitating long-distance communication between individuals. Telecom networks play a crucial
role in individuals' lives by facilitating communication and connectivity. It can be understood
that customer churn in telecom industries are the ones who start switching from one service
provider to another. By analysing user behaviour and network dynamics, telecom companies
can effectively predict and manage churn.
The previous system faced difficulties in efficiently handling churn within the telecom
network. Through the analysis of user behaviour and network dynamics, telecom companies
sought to address this issue by analysing and managing churn more effectively. Machine
learning techniques such as the Random Forest algorithm and XGBoost algorithm have been
used to create robust churn classification models capable of accurately and precisely
forecasting churn events. These models will empower telecom companies to anticipate
customer attrition in advance, enabling them to deploy proactive interventions aimed at
enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
The goal of this project is to equip telecom enterprises with actionable insights and
predictive capabilities to effectively manage churn, optimize service offerings, and cultivate
enduring relationships with their customer base. By embracing data-driven approaches and
leveraging insights derived from the analysis of user behaviour in telecom networks,
companies can navigate the competitive landscape with resilience and drive sustainable growth
in the telecommunications industry.Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer cancelled the subscription. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.
